Validators on the IOTA network run special nodes and have additional tasks and responsibilities beyond those of full node operators.

## Requirements to Run a Validator on IOTA

To run an IOTA validator, you must set up and configure an IOTA Validator node. After you have a running node, you must have a minimum of 2 million IOTA in your staking pool to join the validator set on the IOTA network.

To learn how to set up and configure an IOTA Validator node, see [Docker Setup](docker.mdx) or [Systemd Setup](systemd.mdx). The guide includes all of the information you need to configure your Validator node. It also provides guidance on the tasks you must perform after you join the validator set.

Specific steps you must take include:

- Install and configure IOTA validator node  
- Key management  
- Software updates
- On-chain commands
- Update the Gas Price Survey
- Reporting other validators
