## Hardware requirements

<FullnodeRequirements/>

## 1. Software requirements

- Linux (recommended):
  - For this installer to work, use a Linux distribution with `systemd` and `apt-get`.
  - IOTA recommends and supports Ubuntu or Debian.
  - Building from source also works on macOS (but systemd-related steps won't).
- Rust/cargo stable (recent version, check [rust-toolchain.toml](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/rust-toolchain.toml) for the specific version) . If needed, [update Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

<Ports/>

## 2. Run the installer script

In any directory, run:
```shell
NETWORK="testnet" bash -i <(curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotaledger/iota/refs/heads/develop/setups/fullnode/systemd/setup.sh)
```

:::info
Set the network environment variable to the network you want to connect to ("testnet", "mainnet", or "devnet")
:::

The installer will perform the following steps:
1. Check your rust toolchain version
2. Install system packages (libraries & other dependencies):  
  `tzdata`, `libprotobuf-dev`, `ca-certificates`, `build-essential`, `libssl-dev`, `libclang-dev`, `libpq-dev`, `pkg-config`, `openssl`, `protobuf-compiler`, `git`, `clang`, `cmake`
3. Clone the [iota repo](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota), set to the right branch for the [network](../../developer/getting-started/connect.mdx#iota-networks) you chose
4. Build the iota-node binary  
  The built binary is located at `/opt/iota/bin/iota-node` by default.
5. Create a user called iota, make it own directories for service binary, config, data
6. Create a node config file, download genesis/migration blobs  
  The config and blob files are located at `/opt/iota/config` by default.
6. Create a systemd service unit file  
  The service definition file is located at `/etc/systemd/system/iota-node.service`.
7. Start the service

## 3. Check your installation

Your IOTA node should now be running and connected to the network you chose.

Check that the iota-node service is active and running:
```shell
sudo systemctl status iota-node
```

Check (and follow) the logs:
```shell
journalctl -u iota-node -f
```

If you need to stop the service, you can run `sudo systemctl stop iota-node`

Your IOTA node should now be running and connected to the network you chose.

### Check your node configuration

By default, the configuration file `fullnode.yaml` is located at  `/opt/iota/config/fullnode.yaml`.

<CheckNodeConfig/>

### Reach your node via the RPC endpoint

<TryRpcEndpoint/>

### Troubleshooting

If you run into issues during the setup, or while checking your install, be sure to check common issues in the [troubleshooting section](./troubleshooting.mdx)

## 4. Updating Your Full Node

When IOTA releases a new version, you must update your full node with the release to ensure compatibility with the network it connects to.  
Make sure your node stays on the same network (testnet, mainnet, devnet, ...) it was previously connected to.

To upgrade your node, run the same script you used to install it:
```shell
NETWORK="testnet" bash -i <(curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotaledger/iota/refs/heads/develop/setups/fullnode/systemd/setup.sh)
```

:::info
Re-use the same network (`testnet`, `mainnet`, `devnet`) your node is already running on.
:::

Your full node restarts on: <code>{Networks.iota_localnet.jsonRpcUrl}</code>.

:::info
If your full node is configured to prune transactions, Archival nodes can help ensure lagging peer nodes don't lose any information. For more information, see [IOTA Archives](../common/archives.mdx).
:::

## 5. Customize your node's configuration

:::warning
Node logs can take a lot of space quickly. Make sure to configure your `iota-node` systemd service to rotate or prune logs to not run out of space.
See [systemd docs](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/journald.conf.html#SystemMaxUse=)

You can also lower the log level by editing your service definition file (changing RUST_LOG in `/etc/systemd/system/iota-node.service`), in order to produce less logs.
:::

In the [next section](./configuration.mdx), we'll see which options are available to tune the node's configuration to your preferences.
