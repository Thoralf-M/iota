## Node Health Metrics 

IOTA nodes expose a wide range of metrics to be scraped by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
By default, metrics are available at the `http://localhost:9184/metrics` endpoint.
The best way to visualize these metrics is to use [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).
Additionally, a common approach is to use [node exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) to scrape performance metrics from the node and push them to Prometheus.

### Fetch key health metrics

Key health metrics via the `/metrics` HTTP endpoint:

```sh
curl -s localhost:9184/metrics | grep -E "^last_executed_checkpoint|^highest_synced_checkpoint|^highest_known_checkpoint|^last_committed_round|^consensus_threshold_clock_round|^highest_received_round|^consensus_proposed_blocks|^uptime"
```

For instance, for a validator node, the output would be:
```sh
consensus_proposed_blocks{force="false"} 840272
consensus_proposed_blocks{force="true"} 2255
consensus_threshold_clock_round 1318080
highest_known_checkpoint 60575714
highest_synced_checkpoint 60575710
last_executed_checkpoint 60575714
last_executed_checkpoint_age_ms{pct="50"} 0
last_executed_checkpoint_age_ms{pct="95"} 0
last_executed_checkpoint_age_ms{pct="99"} 0
last_executed_checkpoint_age_ms_count 1342973
last_executed_checkpoint_age_ms_sum 367068033
last_executed_checkpoint_timestamp_ms 1745504535018
uptime{chain_identifier="2304aa97",is_docker="false",os_version="Linux (Ubuntu 24.04)",process="validator",version="0.12.0-rc-7e49c58b826b"} 700369
```

### Ensure node health using last checkpoint timestamp

To make sure your node runs properly, we check that the last processed checkpoint is recent enough:
- 10 seconds is typical
- 30 seconds is still fine
- You want to check that the timestamp difference stays under 1 minute

You can check that from the previous metric `last_executed_checkpoint_timestamp_ms`, and compare timestamps with now using this command:
```shell
last_executed_checkpoint_timestamp_ms="$(curl -s localhost:9184/metrics | grep ^last_executed_checkpoint_timestamp_ms | awk '{print $2}')"
now_timestamp="$(date +%s%3N)"
if (now_timestamp - last_executed_checkpoint_timestamp_ms < 60000); then
	echo "[OK] healthy & in sync"
else
	echo "[ERROR] Node unhealthy. Last known checkpoint is too old."
fi
```
