The native asset on IOTA is called **IOTA**.

At the launch of IOTA Rebased, **4,600,000,000** IOTA tokens were migrated from the previous network called _Stardust_.
**767,000** new IOTA tokens are minted each epoch. As a result, IOTA has no fixed maximum supply — the total supply fluctuates over time based on the balance between token inflation and fee burning.

:::info Decimals

The number of decimals for the IOTA token has changed from **6** to **9** with this release: any balance from the Stardust network has been migrated and multiplied by 1,000 to accommodate.

:::

The IOTA token serves four purposes on the IOTA network:

- **Staking:** You can stake IOTA to participate in the delegated proof-of-stake mechanism.
- **Transaction Fees:** IOTA is the asset denomination needed to pay the gas fees required to execute transactions and store created data on chain or process other operations on the IOTA network.
- **Value transfers:** IOTA can be used as a versatile and liquid asset for various applications, including the standard features of money — a unit of account, a medium of exchange, or a store of value — and more complex functionality enabled by smart contracts, interoperability, and composability across the IOTA ecosystem.
- **Governance:** IOTA tokens play an important role in governance by acting as a right to participate in on-chain voting on issues such as protocol upgrades.

All original IOTA Tokens are represented as the `0x2::iota::IOTA` type of object on IOTA Rebased, accessible on the same (Hex format) addresses from the Stardust-based network. No manual migration is needed to access these tokens.
