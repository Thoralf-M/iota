Use this guide to install and configure an Full Node locally using Docker for testing. The instructions apply to the following operating system and processor combinations:

- Linux/AMD64
- Darwin/AMD64
- Darwin/ARM64

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

## Clone the IOTA repository
<!-- TODO: we can remove this step in case we provide the same setup as in the former node-docker-setup -->
1. The first thing you need to do to set up your Full Node is clone the IOTA repository, you can use the following command or download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git
```

2. Once you have download the source code, move into the docker fullnode directory:
```shell
cd iota/setups/fullnode/docker/
```

## Configure the Full Node

Run the respective prepare script, depending on the network you want to run the Node on.

This will create the `data` folder and copy a template configuration into the `config` subfolder.
You can modify this config file to your needs afterwards.
The script will also download the necessary `genesis.blob` and optionally `migration.blob` for the network.

    <TabItem label="Testnet" value="testnet">
If you want to run the Node on `testnet`, run the following command:
```shell
./prepare_testnet.sh
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Devnet" value="devnet">
If you want to run the Node on `devnet` instead, run the following command:
```shell
./prepare_devnet.sh
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Start Your Full Node

Run the following command to start the Full Node in Docker in a detached mode:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```
You can check the logs of the Full Node by running the following command:

```shell
docker compose logs -f
```

:::tip

These commands assume you are using Docker Compose V2. In Docker Compose V1, the `docker compose` command uses a dash (`docker-compose`). If you use Docker Compose V1, replace the space in each `docker compose` command with a dash (`docker-compose`). For more information, see [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command).

:::

## Stop the Full Node

Run the following command to stop the Full Node when you finish using it:

```shell
docker compose stop
```

## Test and Monitor the Full Node

After the Full Node starts, you can test the [JSON-RPC interfaces](https://docs.iota.org/iota-api-ref).
Also, the best way to make sure your Node is working correctly is to use monitoring tools, to learn more, check the [Monitoring](monitoring.mdx) page.

### View Activity on Your Local Full Node with IOTA Explorer

The IOTA Explorer supports connecting to any network as long as it has `https` enabled. To view activity on your local
Full Node, open the URL: [https://explorer.rebased.iota.org/](https://explorer.rebased.iota.org/), and select Custom
RPC URL from the network dropdown in the top right.

### View Resource Usage (CPU and Memory)

To view resource usage details for the Full Node running in Docker, run the following command:

```shell
docker stats
```

This command shows a live data stream of the Docker container's resource usage, such as CPU and memory. To view data for all containers, use the following command:

```shell
docker stats -a
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors or your Full Node stops working, run the commands in the following section to resolve the issue.

### Reset the Environment

If you continue to see issues, follow the following steps:

- Stop the Full Node

```shell
docker compose down
```

- Delete the `data` folder (make sure to make a copy of your config files if you need them)

```shell
rm -Rf data/
```

- Pull the latest version of the container

```shell
docker compose pull
```

- Run the respective prepare script again depending on your network.

    <TabItem label="Testnet" value="testnet">
```shell
./prepare_testnet.sh
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Devnet" value="devnet">
```shell
./prepare_devnet.sh
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- Start the container again

```shell
docker compose up
```

### Inspect the State of a Running Full Node

Get the running container ID:

```shell
docker ps
```

Connect to a bash shell inside the container:

```shell
docker exec -it $CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
```

Inspect the database:

```shell
ls -la iotadb/
```

### Investigate Local RPC Connectivity Issues

Update the `json-rpc-address` in the Full Node config to listen on all addresses:

```shell
sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/' fullnode.yaml
```

```shell
-json-rpc-address: "127.0.0.1:9000"
+json-rpc-address: "0.0.0.0:9000"
```
