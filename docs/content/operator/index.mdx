Operator guides demonstrate how to run full nodes and validator nodes on IOTA.

## Full Node Operator Guides

IOTA full nodes validate blockchain activities, including transactions, checkpoints, and epoch changes. Each full node stores and services the queries for the blockchain state and history.

## Validator Node Operator Guides

IOTA validators focus on servicing and processing transactions. When a validator commits a new set of transactions (or a block of transactions), the validator pushes that block to all connected full nodes that then service the queries from clients.
