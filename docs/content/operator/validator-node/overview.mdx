Validators on the IOTA network run special nodes and have additional tasks and responsibilities beyond those of full node operators.

## Requirements to Run a Validator Node on IOTA

To run an IOTA validator node, you must:
1. Set up and run a validator node. Follow the setup guides for [Docker](docker.mdx) or [Systemd](systemd.mdx).
2. Ensure your staking pool has at least **2 million IOTA**. This is the minimum required to join the validator set. Other users can delegate IOTA to your pool to help reach this amount.
3. Complete the necessary tasks to join the validator set and maintain the validator status. See the relevant guides for [Docker](docker.mdx) or [Systemd](systemd.mdx) for detailed instructions.

Specific steps you must take include:

- Install and configure IOTA validator node  
- Key management  
- Software updates
- On-chain commands
- Update the Gas Price Survey
- Reporting other validators
