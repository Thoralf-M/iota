The IOTA full node configuration file is a YAML file named `fullnode.yaml`, located in your iota install folder (if you used docker) or in `/opt/iota/config` (if you used systemd).   

You can modify it to configure your IOTA node.

To simplify the setup process, you can use the default configuration file:

<Tabs groupId="network" queryString>
    <TabItem label="Mainnet" value="mainnet">
        ```yaml file=<rootDir>/setups/fullnode/fullnode-mainnet.yaml
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Testnet" value="testnet">
        ```yaml file=<rootDir>/setups/fullnode/fullnode-testnet.yaml
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Devnet" value="devnet">
        ```yaml file=<rootDir>/setups/fullnode/fullnode-devnet.yaml
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
If you used the installer script, it will have generated that config file for you, with default ports, archive and pruning settings, and also covers peering configuration for the selected network.

## Customize your node's configuration

### Networking

To synchronize the state, the node needs to establish connections with other nodes that have already joined the network.   
Ensure that port `8084` is open and set up an external address for node discovery.

See more useful ports and network configuration options [here](configs/network.mdx)

### Storage and pruning (optional)

To keep disk usage in check or save storage space, you can:
- prune old transaction data (transactions, effects, events, checkpoints)
- prune old object versions
- turn off the built-in blockchain indexer

Learn how to choose and set pruning settings [here](configs/pruning.mdx).

### Archival (optional)

If the peers your node syncs with have already pruned data your node needs, your node can fallback onto using archives (files containing historical data).  
Learn how to configure archive settings for your node [here](configs/archives.mdx).

### Snapshots (optional)

If your node fails, it can catch up faster from a recent database snapshot (on restart) than replaying all past transactions since genesis. 
Learn how to configure formal and RocksDB snapshots [here](configs/snapshots.mdx).

### Data storage paths (optional)

To set paths for data files, change these values in `fullnode.yaml`:

```yaml
# Set a custom path for storing the node's database
db-path: "/db-files/iota-fullnode"

# Set a custom path to the genesis blob
genesis:
  genesis-file-location: "/iota-fullnode/genesis.blob"

# Set a custom path for the migration blob
migration-tx-data-path: "/opt/iota/config/migration.blob"
```

## Restart your node after making changes

After changing any of the node's settings, restart your node using:

<Tabs groupId="setup-method">
    <TabItem label="Systemd" value="systemd">
      ```shell
      sudo systemctl restart iota-node
      ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Docker" value="docker">
      ```shell
      docker compose restart
      ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
