# Networks & Chains

## IOTA EVM Testnet

<AddToMetaMaskButton {...Networks['iota_testnet']} />

[The IOTA EVM Testnet](https://explorer.evm.testnet.iotaledger.net/) runs as a layer 2 on top
of the IOTA Testnet. This network uses ISC to facilitate
an Ethereum Virtual Machine and has an enshrined bridge to layer 1.

:::info

This network is subject to occasional resets (no data retention) which are usually announced with a one-week grace period.

<NetworkInfo.Evm {...Networks['iota_testnet']} />

:::note

The other values (network name and currency symbol) can be whatever value you like.

## IOTA EVM

[IOTA EVM](https://explorer.evm.iota.org) is the L2 EVM running on top of the IOTA network.

## Core Contracts

[IOTA EVM](#iota-evm) and the testnet networks have 7
[core contracts](../references/core-contracts/overview.md) deployed, as well as the
[Magic Contract](../references/magic-contract/introduction.md).
