## 3. What are the hardware requirements for validators?

[Validators](https://docs.iota.org/operator/validator-node/overview) are expected to have:

<ValidatorRequirementsTab/>

## 4. What happens to the existing IOTA EVM?

The [IOTA EVM](https://wiki.iota.org/isc/introduction/) on Layer 2 will:

- **Continue Operating:** It will eventually run alongside the new IOTA Rebased Layer 1.
- **Integration Plans:** Future plans include integrating EVM capabilities directly into Layer 1.
- **Temporary Pause During Upgrade:** The EVM chain will be paused and upgraded but will resume normal operations
  afterward.

## 5. What are the key features introduced with IOTA Rebased?

Key features include:

- **L1 Smart Contracts:** Smart contract capabilities directly on the Layer 1 network using MoveVM.
- **[Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS)](./tokenomics/proof-of-stake.mdx):** A fully decentralized network governed by validators and stakers.
- **[Enhanced Tokenomics](./tokenomics/tokenomics.mdx):** Staking rewards, transaction fees with fee-burning, and storage deposits.
- **[Improved Security and Performance](./iota-architecture/iota-security.mdx):** Resilient [consensus](./iota-architecture/consensus.mdx) mechanisms, fairer gas pricing, and dynamic validator selection.

## 6. Why is IOTA moving to the MoveVM and an object-based architecture?

The shift to the MoveVM and an object-based architecture is designed to:

- **Enhance Flexibility and Programmability:** Allow complex applications to be written via smart contracts directly on L1.
- **Support Advanced Use Cases:** Enable sophisticated financial instruments, decentralized exchanges, and intricate supply chain systems.
- **Improve Security:** Leverage MoveVM features like resource-oriented programming and static verification to enhance security.
- **Simplify Development:** Provide strong data abstraction capabilities and support for formal verification, improving the developer experience.

## 7. How will the tokenomics change under the IOTA Rebased proposal?

The new tokenomics model includes:

- **[Staking Rewards](./tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx):** Validators and delegators receive newly minted IOTA tokens as rewards (approximately 767,000 IOTAs per epoch), resulting in an initial annual inflation rate of about 6%.
- **[Transaction Fees](./tokenomics/gas-in-iota.mdx):** Small fees are charged on transactions (around 0.005 IOTA for an average transaction) and are burned to create deflationary pressure.
- **[Storage Deposits](./tokenomics/gas-in-iota.mdx#storage-units):** A redeemable deposit is required for storage, similar to the storage deposit system used in IOTA Stardust.

## 8. How does staking work in the new tokenomics model?

Staking involves:

- **[Delegation to Validators](./tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx):** Token holders can delegate their tokens to validators to help secure the network.
- **[Earning Rewards](./tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx#validator-pool-rewards):** Both validators and their delegators receive staking rewards from newly minted tokens.
- **Proportional Distribution:** Rewards are distributed based on the amount of stake and validator commissions.

## 9. How will the new fee-burning mechanism work?

The fee-burning mechanism:

- **Burns Transaction Fees:** Collected fees are burned, reducing the overall token supply.
- **Deflationary Effect:** Increased network usage leads to more fees burned, creating deflationary pressure.
- **Supply Dynamics:** The mechanism balances inflation from staking rewards and deflation from fee burning.

## 10. How will the introduction of transaction fees affect users?

Transaction fees are minimal and serve as a congestion control mechanism:

- **Low Fees:** Approximately 0.005 IOTA per average transaction.
- **Fee Burning:** Fees are burned to reduce the total supply, creating deflationary pressure.
- **Staking Rewards Offset Fees:** Users can earn staking rewards that may exceed the cost of transaction fees.
- **Sponsored Transactions:** Developers can cover transaction fees on behalf of users, allowing for feeless user experiences.

## 11. How will this affect current token holders?

For current token holders:

- **Balances Maintained:** All balances will be migrated to the new network without loss.
- **Same Private Keys:** Users can access their tokens using their existing private keys in the new IOTA Wallet.
- **[Staking Opportunities](./tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx):** Token holders can participate in staking or delegation to earn rewards.

## 12. Firefly Isn't Working

**Firefly for IOTA is deprecated** and no longer supports the new IOTA Mainnet network.

You should switch to the [new IOTA Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iota-wallet/lfhohhmmcplfddhojblhpbblpbcoecha).

- You can import your **mnemonic** or connect your **Ledger device**.
- If the in-app updater is broken (on Windows), [download the latest version manually from Firefly](https://firefly.iota.org/).

## 13. How to Migrate from Firefly/Bloom?

Firefly IOTA is no longer compatible with the new IOTA Mainnet. Please migrate to the new [IOTA Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iota-wallet/lfhohhmmcplfddhojblhpbblpbcoecha).

### Using a Mnemonic:
1. Go to the new wallet.
2. Create a new profile by importing your mnemonic.
3. See: [Getting Started with the IOTA Wallet](../about-iota/iota-wallet/getting-started.mdx)

### Using a Ledger Device:
1. Ensure your IOTA Ledger App is up to date:

2. Install via Ledger Live.
3. See: [Use IOTA Wallet with a Ledger Device](../about-iota/iota-wallet/how-to/integrate-ledger.mdx)

If you're using a **Ledger Nano S**, follow this [specific guide](../about-iota/iota-wallet/how-to/integrate-ledger.mdx).

:::info
After importing your mnemonic or connecting your Ledger, run the **Balance Finder**. This tool will help locate all your addresses. You may need to press "search" multiple times, especially if your funds are widely distributed.

:::

:::tip

Tip: It's easier to use the Balance Finder from the expanded wallet view.

:::

## 14. I Have Missing Balances. Where's My Money?

1. Ensure you're using the **correct mnemonic, seed, or Ledger**.
2. Use the **Balance Finder** to search for all your addresses:
   - [How to use Balance Finder](../about-iota/iota-wallet/getting-started.mdx)

3. After finding your addresses, go to the [IOTA Wallet Dashboard](../about-iota/iota-wallet-dashboard/getting-started.mdx) and check:
   - **Migration Tab**: For unmigrated Stardust balances  
     [Migrate Stardust Assets](../about-iota/iota-wallet-dashboard/how-to/migration.mdx)
   - **Vesting Tab**: For airdropped or locked funds from the October 2024 upgrade  
     [Manage Vesting and Time-Locked Assets](../about-iota/iota-wallet-dashboard/how-to/vesting.mdx)

## 15. I'm Sure My Funds Are in a Specific Address But They’re Not Showing

1. Connect that address to the [Wallet Dashboard](../about-iota/iota-wallet-dashboard/getting-started.mdx).
2. Navigate to the **Migration** tab and copy your legacy address.
3. Paste it into the [Archived Tangle Explorer](https://archive.explorer.iota.org) to check past balances.

If you don’t see your funds there, they are likely in a **different address**. Run the **Balance Finder** again.

## 16. I Can't Connect My New Accounts to the Wallet Dashboard

This is a known issue. Please follow these steps:

1. Go to `IOTA Wallet > Apps Tabs > Active Connections > Wallet Dashboard`.
2. **Disconnect all** accounts.
3. Reconnect them again from the Wallet Dashboard.

## 17. I Lost My Mnemonic. Can I Still Migrate?

Yes—if you still have your **Stronghold file** and its **password**, you can extract the seed:

1. Use **Firefly v2.1.0+** to extract the seed.
   - [Restore From Seed or Stronghold](../about-iota/iota-wallet/how-to/restore-account.mdx)
2. Import the extracted mnemonic into the new wallet:
   - [Getting Started with the IOTA Wallet](../about-iota/iota-wallet/getting-started.mdx)

:::note
Restoring from seed is not an industry standard and may only work with IOTA Foundation-supported wallets. Once restored, transfer your funds to a wallet with a **known mnemonic**.
:::

## 18. Importing a Stronghold Crashes Firefly

If you still have a Firefly profile:
- Follow this guide to export the seed:  
  [Back up a Seed from a Firefly Profile](../about-iota/iota-wallet/how-to/restore-account.mdx)

If you **don’t** have the profile:
1. Download [Firefly Shimmer](https://firefly.iota.org/).
2. Create a Shimmer profile using your **mnemonic**.
3. Log out and export the seed:  
   [Guide to Exporting Seed](../about-iota/iota-wallet/how-to/restore-account.mdx)

## 19. What Does It Mean If My Account is Marked as "Legacy"?

This means your addresses originate from the **"Chrysalis rotating address era"**. These addresses are considered outdated and may not be recognized by newer wallets.

:::info
**We recommend** moving your funds out of legacy addresses to ensure compatibility and accessibility.

## 21. Will transaction fees impact the feeless nature of IOTA?

Yes, but:

- **Minimal Impact:** Fees are very low and designed as a congestion control mechanism.
- **Net Gain for Users:** Staking rewards can offset transaction fees, potentially resulting in more tokens than before.
- **Sponsored Transactions:** Developers can sponsor fees, allowing users to transact without holding IOTA tokens.

## 22. How will the governance vote work?

The governance vote allows IOTA token holders to decide on the proposed upgrade:

- **Announcement Phase:** The proposal is announced, and the community is informed.
- **Voting Open Phase (7 days):** Voters cast their ballots before counting begins.
- **Counting Phase (7 days):** Votes accumulate over time; each IOTA token accumulates voting power at a rate of 0.01 votes per milestone.
- **Quorum Requirement:** A minimum of 5% of the circulating supply must participate for the vote to be valid.
- **Outcome Determination:** The option with the majority of votes prevails.

## 23. What happens if the proposal is accepted?

If accepted:

- **Mainnet Upgrade:** The IOTA network will transition to the new IOTA Rebased protocol after thorough testing and audits.
- **Network Transition:** A final snapshot of the current network will migrate balances to the new network on a 1:1 basis.
- **IOTA EVM Chain Upgrade:** The IOTA EVM Layer 2 chain will be temporarily paused and upgraded to integrate with the new ledger.
- **Wallet Transition:** The IOTA Firefly wallet will be discontinued. Users can access their holdings with the new IOTA Wallet using the same private keys.
- **Token Continuity:** No token migration is necessary; tokens will be available immediately after the launch.

## 24. What happens if the proposal is rejected?

If rejected:

- **Current Operations Continue:** The IOTA network will continue operating as it currently does.
- **Future Decisions:** The IOTA Foundation will decide on future development paths and how to proceed with network improvements.

## 25. What is the IOTA Rebased proposal?

The IOTA Rebased proposal is a significant upgrade to the IOTA protocol that aims to enhance the network's capabilities by:

- **Transitioning to an Object-Based Architecture:** Moving away from the current UTXO model to an object-based ledger.
- **Introducing the Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM):** Implementing MoveVM to enable Layer 1 (L1) smart contract capabilities.
- **Establishing Full Decentralization:** Adopting a delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS) system with validators and stakers to secure the network.
- **Updating Tokenomics:** Introducing staking rewards, transaction fees, and a fee-burning mechanism to create a dynamic supply.

## 26. What is the future roadmap for IOTA?

The future roadmap includes:

- **Protocol Refinements:** Enhancements like resilient consensus mechanisms and fairer gas pricing.
- **Multi-VM Ledger:** Transitioning to support multiple virtual machines, including EVM, on Layer 1.
- **Tooling and Products:** Developing new wallets, SDKs, CLI tools, and identity solutions.
- **Mainnet Launch Timeline:** A potential launch in early 2025 after thorough testing and audits.

## 27. Why is IOTA making this change now?

The change addresses:

- **Market Demands:** There's a clear need for Layer 1 programmability and smart contracts to meet modern application requirements.
- **Technological Evolution:** The new architecture allows for faster, more secure, and scalable solutions.
- **Avoiding Delays:** Continuing with the current roadmap would require additional years of research and development with uncertain outcomes.
