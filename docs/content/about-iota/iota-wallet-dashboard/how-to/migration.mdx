# Migrate Stardust Assets

You can use the IOTA Wallet Dashboard to migrate native NFTs and
native tokens that need migrating. 


## Access the Migration View

If your wallet has assets you need to migrate, you will see a `Start Migration` button in the top right of the
Dashboard. 
Alternatively, you can access the Migration View from the left side menu.

## View Migration Details

Once in the [Migration view](#access-the-migration-view), you will see an overview of any assets you need to migrate.

You can click on the `See All` button to get a detailed view of the assets by type.

## Start the Migration

:::info About Time-locked Assets

In Stardust, you could add time locks to assets. This means that you could send transfers tokens that could only be
unlocked after a set amount of time. The migration tool can give you an overview of these, but since the assets are
still time-lock you will not be able to migrate them until the lock has expired.

:::

Once you've reviewed the migration details, you can click on the `Migrate All` button to start the asset migration.

The migration dashboard will give you an overview of assets that will be migrated, their legacy storage deposit that
will be rebated and the [gas fees](../../tokenomics/gas-in-iota.mdx) for the transaction.

After you have reviewed the assets and costs, hit the `Migrate` button, and confirm the transaction in your [IOTA Wallet](../../iota-wallet/getting-started.mdx).
