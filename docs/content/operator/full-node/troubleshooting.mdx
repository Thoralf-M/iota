If you encounter errors or your full node stops working, run the commands in the following section to resolve the issue.

## Issues during setup

<Tabs groupId="setup-method">
    <TabItem label="Systemd" value="systemd">
      ### `Error: cannot find -lpq`

      If, during the compilation step, you receive a `cannot find -lpq` error, you are missing the `libpq` library. 
      Use `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev` to install on Linux, or `brew install libpq` on MacOS. 
      After you install on MacOS, create a Homebrew link using `brew link --force libpq`. 
      For further context, reference the [issue on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70313347/ld-library-not-found-for-lpq-when-build-rust-in-macos?rq=1).

      ### `Error: Listener: Address already in use`

      If you receive the following error:

      ```shell
      panicked at error binding to 0.0.0.0:9184: error creating server listener: Address already in use (os error 98)
      ```

      Update the metrics address in your `fullnode.yaml` file to use port `9180`.

      ```yaml
      metrics-address: "0.0.0.0:9180"
      ```
    </TabItem>

      No known issues with the docker setup yet.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Inspecting the state of a running node

<Tabs groupId="setup-method">
    <TabItem label="Systemd" value="systemd">
      Looking at the logs for specific errors:
      ```shell
      journalctl -u iota-node -f
      ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Docker" value="docker">
      Looking at the logs for specific errors:
      ```shell
      docker compose logs iota-node -f
      ```

      Connecting to a shell inside the container:
      ```shell
      docker exec -it $CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
      ```

      Inspecting the database:
      ```shell
      ls -la iotadb/
      ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Reinstalling the node from scratch

If you continue to see issues, do the following steps:

<Tabs groupId="setup-method">
    <TabItem label="Systemd" value="systemd">
      To re-install your node from scratch, run the same script you used to install it:

      ```shell
      NETWORK="testnet" bash -i <(curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotaledger/iota/refs/heads/develop/setups/fullnode/systemd/setup.sh)
      ```

      :::info
      Re-use the same network (`testnet`, `mainnet`, `devnet`) your node is already running on.
      :::
    </TabItem>


    <TabItem label="Docker" value="docker">
      Stop the full node
      ```shell
      docker compose down
      ```

      Delete the data folder
      Make sure to first make a backup of your config files
      ```shell
      rm -Rf data/
      ```

      Pull the latest version of the container
      ```shell
      docker compose pull
      ```

      Run the prepare script again
      ```shell
      ./prepare.sh
      ```

      Start the container again

      ```shell
      docker compose up
      ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Local RPC Connectivity Issues

Update the `json-rpc-address` in the full node config to listen on all addresses:

```shell
sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/' fullnode.yaml
```

```shell
-json-rpc-address: "127.0.0.1:9000"
+json-rpc-address: "0.0.0.0:9000"
```
