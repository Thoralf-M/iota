## 3. Join the Validators

:::info Key Security

The following steps should be executed in the same environment you used while creating the validator keys.

:::

Make sure your validator account created in [Generate Validator Information](https://docs.iota.org/operator/validator-node/systemd#1-generate-validator-information) has enough IOTA to cover the gas costs.

:::note Tesnet Faucet
On the Testnet you can use the Faucet to receive the necessary funds.
:::

Before joining the validators, ensure you have enough delegated stake by running the following command:

```bash
iota validator display-metadata --json true  | grep stakingPoolIotaBalance
```

You need [at least 2M iota to join the validators](https://docs.iota.org/about-iota/tokenomics/validators-staking#validator-staking-pool-requirements).
So make sure the `stakingPoolIotaBalance` is at least `2_000_000_000_000_000`.

Once your have enough stake, submit your request to join the validators:

```bash
iota validator join-validators
```

## 4. Monitor Validator Status

```bash
iota validator display-metadata --json true
```

You should see your validator's status is `Pending` now, it will become active and join the validators starting from next epoch.

```
<YOUR-VALIDATOR_ADDRESS>'s validator status: Pending
```
