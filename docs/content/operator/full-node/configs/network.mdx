import Ports from './../../../_snippets/operator/fullnode-ports.mdx'
import TestnetNodeConfig from "../../../_snippets/network-node-config-testnet.mdx";
import DevnetNodeConfig from "../../../_snippets/network-node-config-devnet.mdx";

## Connectivity

To synchronize the state, the node needs to establish connections with other nodes that have already joined the network. Ensure that port `8084` is open and set up an external address for node discovery.

The full node uses the following ports by default:

<Ports/>

## Known peers

By default, your config file (`fullnode.yaml`) should include the following known peers (from public nodes run by the IOTA Foundation):

<Tabs groupId="network">
    <TabItem label="Testnet" value="testnet">
        <TestnetNodeConfig />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Devnet" value="devnet">
        <DevnetNodeConfig />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
