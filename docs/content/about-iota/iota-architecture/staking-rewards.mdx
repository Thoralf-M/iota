# Staking and Rewards

IOTA uses a [Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)](../tokenomics/proof-of-stake.mdx) system, where [validators](../tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx) get their
voting power from IOTA token holders who delegate their stakes to them.
When rewards are distributed at the end of each [epoch](epochs.mdx),
validators receive their [rewards](#rewards-distribution) based on their [performance](#performance)
and [commission rate](#commission-rate).
The rewards automatically increase as validators' staking pools receive new delegated stakes.

## Staking on IOTA vs. Other Blockchains

The IOTA staking mechanism has some unique features compared to other blockchains.

### Self-custodial Staking

Stakers keep their staked IOTA tokens in their own account.

### Auto-compounding Rewards

Rewards automatically reinvest due to a liquidity-pool-inspired design.

### Staking Timing

When a user stakes with a validator, their stake counts towards the validator's voting power starting from the next
epoch. Similarly, when a user withdraws their stake, it stops counting from the next epoch.

## Rewards Distribution

At the end of each [epoch](epochs.mdx), newly minted IOTA tokens are distributed as rewards among validators and stakers. Within each [validator staking](../tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx) pool, stakers receive rewards proportionally through the appreciation of the pool's exchange rate. Validators also earn additional rewards, represented as StakedIOTA objects, which they receive at the end of each epoch in proportion to the commissions generated by their staking pool.

Each epoch's rewards are funded by newly minted IOTA tokens, totaling 767k IOTA per epoch. This amount is distributed across staking pools based on their voting power and the specified tallying rule. The amount of rewards a validator gets depends on.

:::tip Validator Selection

Refer to the [Proof-of-Stake](../tokenomics/proof-of-stake.mdx) page to learn how validators are selected for transaction processing and the underlying economic model.

### Performance

If a validator underperforms, other validators can report them, causing the reported validator to lose all their rewards
for that epoch.

### Commission Rate

This is the percentage a validator takes from their stakers' rewards. 
For example, if a validator's commission rate is 10%, they take 10% of the rewards each epoch as new stake objects.

### Rewards Withdrawal

Validators receive rewards as regular stake objects, so they withdraw their staking rewards the same way as stakers.
Validators can call
the [`0x3::iota_system::request_withdraw_stake`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/crates/iota-framework/packages/iota-system/sources/iota_system.move#L260)
function to withdraw their stake and receive their rewards.
