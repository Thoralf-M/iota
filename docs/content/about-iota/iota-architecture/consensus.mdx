The primary goal of consensus in distributed systems is to establish a consistent order of transactions and ensure their availability. In IOTA, consensus is achieved through a combination of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) and the Mysticeti Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol.

IOTA's consensus mechanism ensures:

- **Low latency**: Transactions are confirmed quickly due to efficient leader election and consensus mechanisms.
- **High throughput**: The protocol can process a large number of transactions per second, ensuring scalability.
- **Fast finality**: Transactions reach finality in a short time, reducing the risk of rollbacks.
- **Energy efficiency**: Unlike Proof-of-Work (PoW), Mysticeti's consensus mechanism requires minimal computational resources.
- **Security & decentralization**: The protocol resists common attacks by relying on an honest majority of validators while maintaining a decentralized structure.

## Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) in IOTA

IOTA employs Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) as the overarching consensus mechanism. In this model:

- Token holders delegate their voting power to validators.
- Validators participate in block production and execute the Mysticeti protocol to finalize transactions.
- Staking rewards serve as the main incentive for validators to behave honestly and secure the network.
- This structure ensures security and decentralization while maintaining scalability.

## Consensus Committee

Validators that participate in the consensus protocol collectively form the **Consensus Committee**. This committee is responsible for executing the consensus mechanism and finalizing transactions.

### Key Aspects of the Consensus Committee

- **Validator Set**: The consensus committee consists of validators, which are selected based on delegated stake.
- **Fixed Over an Epoch**: The validator set remains unchanged during an epoch to ensure stability.
- **Roles of Validators**:
  - Accept transactions and execute the consensus protocol.
  - Maintain a consistently ordered ledger state.
  - Prevent double-spending and conflicts.

For more details on validator staking, refer to the [Validators Staking](../tokenomics/validators-staking.mdx) page. To understand epoch transitions, see the [Epochs](./epochs.mdx) documentation.

## The Mysticeti Protocol

The **Mysticeti** protocol is a _BFT_ consensus protocol optimized for **low-latency** and **high-throughput** using an uncertified _DAG_ structure. It is designed to facilitate efficient and parallel transaction processing while maintaining strong security guarantees.

### Key Features of Mysticeti

- **Parallel Block Proposals**: Multiple validators can propose blocks simultaneously, maximizing network bandwidth and ensuring censorship resistance. This is a core advantage of DAG-based protocols.
- **Three-Round Commit Rule**: Transactions achieve finality in just three rounds of messages, matching the efficiency of pBFT and reaching the theoretical minimum for BFT consensus.
- **Optimized Voting**: Unlike traditional leader-based protocols, Mysticeti allows validators to vote on blocks and certify them in parallel, significantly reducing median and tail latencies.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The protocol tolerates unavailable or faulty validators without significantly increasing commit latencies.
