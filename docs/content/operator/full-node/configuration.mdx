The IOTA full node configuration file is a YAML file (usually named `fullnode.yaml`) that you can use to configure your `iota-node`.
To smooth the setup process, you can use a full node configuration file [template](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/setups/fullnode/fullnode-template.yaml) and modify it to your needs.

Depending on the network you want to connect to, you need to adjust the peering configuration in the configuration file and download a correct genesis blob (for more details, see the [genesis](configs/genesis.mdx) page).
Download the latest version of the IOTA full node configuration for the network you want to connect to:

    <TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">
```shell
wget -O fullnode.yaml https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/raw/develop/setups/fullnode/fullnode-template-testnet.yaml
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="devnet" label="Devnet">
```shell
wget -O fullnode.yaml https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/raw/develop/setups/fullnode/fullnode-template-devnet.yaml
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This default template uses default ports, archive and pruning settings, and also covers peering configuration for the selected network.
If you're fine with the default settings, you can use the template as is and continue with the node setup either [using Docker](docker.mdx) or [build it from source](source.mdx).

For more specific guidance on how to configure your node to suit your needs, e.g., configure snapshot, refer to the following sections:
  - [Genesis](configs/genesis.mdx) - more details on genesis.
  - [Network](configs/network.mdx) - peering configuration for the node.
  - [Pruning](configs/pruning.mdx) - how to prune your IOTA Full Node to leverage storage space.
  - [Snapshots](configs/snapshots.mdx) - how to configure formal and RocksDB snapshots for your IOTA Full Node.
  - [Archives](configs/archives.mdx) - how to configure archives for your IOTA Full Node.
