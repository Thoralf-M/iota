Use this guide to install and configure an full node locally using Docker.

<WarningAdvanced/>

## Hardware requirements

<FullnodeRequirements/>

## Software requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

<Ports/>

## Download the Full Node Docker Setup

In a directory of your choice, run the following:

<Tabs groupId="network" queryString>
    <TabItem label="Mainnet" value="mainnet">
        ```shell
        mkdir iota-fullnode-docker-setup && cd iota-fullnode-docker-setup && curl -L https://fullnode-docker-setup.iota.org/mainnet | tar -zx
        ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Testnet" value="testnet">
        ```shell
        mkdir iota-fullnode-docker-setup && cd iota-fullnode-docker-setup && curl -L https://fullnode-docker-setup.iota.org/testnet | tar -zx
        ```
    </TabItem>
    
    <TabItem label="Devnet" value="devnet">
        ```shell
        mkdir iota-fullnode-docker-setup && cd iota-fullnode-docker-setup && curl -L https://fullnode-docker-setup.iota.org/devnet | tar -zx
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The command will perform the following steps:
- creates and changes into the `iota-fullnode-docker-setup` directory
- downloads the zipped configuration for the specific network, containing the docker-compose and node configuration files, and unzips them

You can modify the node configuration file (`data/config/fullnode.yaml`) according to your needs.

## Prepare your Full Node

Run the following command in the same directory:

```shell
./prepare.sh
```

This script will perform the following steps:
- download the latest docker images specified in the docker-compose.yaml
- download the network specific snapshot files that are needed to sync the node from genesis

## Configure P2P Settings

<FullnodeP2P />

## Start your Full Node

In the same directory, start your node by running:  
```shell
docker compose up -d
```

You can check the logs of the full node by running:
```shell
docker compose logs -f
```

:::tip
These commands assume you are using Docker Compose V2. In Docker Compose V1, the `docker compose` command uses a dash (`docker-compose`). If you use Docker Compose V1, replace the space in each `docker compose` command with a dash (`docker-compose`). For more information, see [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command).
:::

## Stop the Full Node

Run the following command to stop the full node when you finish using it:

```shell
docker compose stop
```

## Check your Installation 

### Check your Full Node Configuration

By default, the configuration file `fullnode.yaml` is located at `<your-fullnode-install-path>/data/config/`.

If you changed your local configuration you can always go back to the default [Full Node Configuration](https://docs.iota.org/operator/full-node/configuration).

### Try reaching your Full Node on the RPC endpoint
