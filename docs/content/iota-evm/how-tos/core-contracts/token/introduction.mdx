# Native Token and ERC20NativeToken

<ERC20/>

The IOTA L1 has functionality to create L1 tokens, also called native tokens. To use these native tokens on L2, you have
a ERC20 contract called `ERC20NativeToken`. The following guides will show you how to [create a foundry](create-foundry.mdx)
that can [mint your own L1 token from L2](mint-token.mdx), and [register](register-token.mdx) it as `ERC20NativeToken`, 
so it can be used like any other ERC20 token with some additional features.
