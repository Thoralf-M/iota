Use this guide to install and configure an full node locally using Docker for testing. The instructions apply to the following operating system and processor combinations:

- Linux/AMD64
- Darwin/AMD64
- Darwin/ARM64

<WarningAdvanced/>

## Hardware requirements

<FullnodeRequirements/>

## Software requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

<Ports/>

## Clone the IOTA repository
<!-- TODO: we can remove this step in case we provide the same setup as in the former node-docker-setup -->
1. The first thing you need to do to set up your full node is clone the IOTA repository, you can use the following command or download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git
```

2. Once you have download the source code, move into the docker fullnode directory:
```shell
cd iota/setups/fullnode/docker/
```

## Configure the Full Node

Run the respective prepare script, depending on the network you want to run the Node on.

This will create the `data` folder and copy a template configuration into the `config` subfolder.
You can modify this config file to your needs afterwards.
The script will also download the necessary `genesis.blob` and optionally `migration.blob` for the network.

<Tabs groupId="network" queryString>
    <TabItem label="Testnet" value="testnet">
If you want to run the Node on `testnet`, run the following command:
```shell
./prepare_testnet.sh
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Devnet" value="devnet">
If you want to run the Node on `devnet` instead, run the following command:
```shell
./prepare_devnet.sh
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Start Your Full Node

Run the following command to start the full node in Docker in a detached mode:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```
You can check the logs of the full node by running the following command:

```shell
docker compose logs -f
```

:::tip
These commands assume you are using Docker Compose V2. In Docker Compose V1, the `docker compose` command uses a dash (`docker-compose`). If you use Docker Compose V1, replace the space in each `docker compose` command with a dash (`docker-compose`). For more information, see [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command).
:::

## Stop the Full Node

Run the following command to stop the full node when you finish using it:

```shell
docker compose stop
```

## Check your installation 

### Check your node configuration

<CheckNodeConfig/>

### Try reaching your node on the RPC endpoint
