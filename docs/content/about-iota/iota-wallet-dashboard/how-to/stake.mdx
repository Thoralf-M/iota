## Access the Staking Feature

To start staking your IOTA tokens, follow these steps:

1. Open your IOTA Wallet and navigate to the Dashboard Home screen and click the `Staking` button on the left hand menu.

Once you request a withdrawal, your staking rewards will stop,
and any earned rewards will be distributed at the end of the current epoch.

1. Go to the `Home` tab and select `Current Stake`.
