:::tip

After importing your wallet, you may notice a `Vesting` or `Migration` label, indicating that you will need to take
action to migrate all your funds, or that you have vested tokens.

If so, please follow the [Migration
Guide](../iota-wallet-dashboard/how-to/migration.mdx) or the [Vesting Guide](../iota-wallet-dashboard/how-to/vesting.mdx).

## Use the Balance Finder

[The way accounts and wallets are managed in the IOTA Wallet is different than in Firefly and similar Stardust Wallets](#whats-changed).
You can use the IOTA balance finder to import all your Firefly wallets and unify them into a single profile. 

### How to Access the Balance Finder

If you are importing a profile, you will be prompted to use the Balance Finder as part of the import process.

   ![Balance Finder in Prompt](/img/about-iota/iota-wallet/getting-started/access-balance-finder-prompt.png)

You can also access the balance finder by clicking on the meatball menu (`...`) beside the desired account dropdown in the
`Manage Accounts` section.

### Find Balances

Once you have [accessed the Balance Finder](#how-to-access-the-balance-finder), hit the `Search` button and the
Balance Finder will retrieve any sub-accounts related to your main account.

:::tip 

If you still have any missing balances, hit `Search` again.

### Migrate Your Stardust Assets

If you have NFTs or native tokens that need migration, you will see a button indicating that you need to migrate
them.

   ![Migration Button](/img/about-iota/iota-wallet/getting-started/migration-button.png)

When you click on it, it prompt you to use the [IOTA Wallet
Dashboard](../iota-wallet-dashboard/getting-started.mdx) to migrate them.

## Vesting & Staked Vesting

If your account has vested tokens, you will see a button indicating that you can access Vested Staking

   ![Migration Button](/img/about-iota/iota-wallet/getting-started/vested-staking-button.png)

When you click on it, it prompt you to use the [IOTA Wallet
Dashboard](../iota-wallet-dashboard/getting-started.mdx) to manage your vested tokens.

   ![Migration Pop In](/img/about-iota/iota-wallet/getting-started/vested-staking-pop-in.png)

## What's Changed?

### Account Management

In Firefly, accounts were structured using a multi-account index, 
which allowed generating multiple addresses under a single account without exposing the underlying BIP32 derivation
paths. In practice, this means that Firefly would display a single wallet account that actually represented `n` addresses.

The IOTA Wallet now displays each address individually.
This change provides transparency for users managing accounts across different wallets or tools.

When restoring accounts by importing a mnemonic phrase or seed,
the IOTA Wallet will display the main account by default.
To access derived accounts use the [Balance Finder](#use-the-balance-finder) tool to scan for assets associated with historical paths.
This ensures compatibility with Firefly’s legacy multi-account framework. 

:::note Legacy Chrysalis Accounts

If you are trying to restore an Legacy Chrysalis-era account from a mnemonic in a third-party wallet, you may notice a
discrepancy in the amount of IOTA in your wallet. You should use the [Balance Finder](#use-the-balance-finder) in the
IOTA Web Wallet and move all your funds in `Legacy` addresses to a new address to be able to access them in any wallet.

:::

### Stronghold Has Been Deprecated

<Seed />

The new IOTA Wallet does not support Stronghold. If you have your mnemonic, private key or seed, you can use them to
[import your account](#importing-an-existing-wallet). 

Alternatively, if you only have your seed or `.stronghold` file backup and know the password, you should follow the
[Restore Account guide](./how-to/restore-account.mdx).
