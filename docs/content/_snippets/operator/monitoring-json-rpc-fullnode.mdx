## JSON-RPC Endpoint

### Test JSON RPC Interface
After the full node starts, you can test the [JSON-RPC interfaces](https://docs.iota.org/iota-api-ref).

### View Activity on Your Local Full Node with IOTA Explorer

The IOTA Explorer supports connecting to any network as long as it has `https` enabled. To view activity on your local full node:
- open the URL: [https://explorer.rebased.iota.org/](https://explorer.rebased.iota.org/)
- then select `Custom RPC URL` from the network dropdown in the top right.

### Fetch latest checkpoint using JSON-RPC
```shell
curl --json '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"iota_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber","params":[]}' localhost:9000 -s | jq .result
```

To ensure node health, you can check that this value matches the latest checkpoint known by the rest of the network by using the value found on https://explorer.rebased.iota.org/
