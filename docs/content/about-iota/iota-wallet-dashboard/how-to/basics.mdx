# Basics

You can use the IOTA Wallet Dashboard for anything you would use your [IOTA
Wallet](../../iota-wallet/getting-started.mdx), as well as [migrating](../how-to/migration.mdx) and [managing
assets](../how-to/assets.mdx), and [managing your vested tokens](../how-to/vesting.mdx).

## Assets and Activity Overview

After you have [connected your wallet](../getting-started.mdx#connect-your-wallet), you will see an overview of your
coins and assets, as well as recent activity.
