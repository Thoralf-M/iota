IOTA provides a command line interface (CLI) tool to interact with the IOTA network, its features, and the Move programming language. The complete suite of tools is called the IOTA CLI, with commands grouped together by feature. Each group of commands is commonly referred to by its top-level command: IOTA Client CLI, IOTA Console CLI, IOTA Keytool CLI, IOTA Move CLI, and IOTA Validator CLI.

## Update CLI

To get the latest version of the CLI, you can run the following command from a terminal or console. Be sure to replace `<BRANCH-NAME>` with `develop`, `devnet`, `testnet`, or `mainnet` to get the desired version. For more information on the branches available, see [IOTA Environment Setup](/developer/getting-started/iota-environment.mdx).

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git --branch <BRANCH-NAME> --features gas-profiler iota
```

:::info

The `--features gas-profiler` flag is necessary only if you want to run gas profiles for transactions.

## IOTA CLI commands

There are a number of top-level commands available, to get an overview of them, use the `iota help` command.
The six most useful commands to users are the following:

- **[IOTA Client CLI](./cli/client.mdx):** Use the `iota client` command to interact with the IOTA network.
- **[IOTA Client PTB CLI](./cli/ptb.mdx):** Use the `iota client ptb` command to build and execute PTBs.
- **[IOTA Console CLI](./cli/console.mdx):** Use `iota console` to open an interactive console with the currently active network.
- **[IOTA Keytool CLI](./cli/keytool.mdx):** Use the `iota keytool` command to access cryptography utilities.
- **[IOTA Move CLI](./cli/move.mdx):** Use the `iota move` command to work with the Move programming language.
- **[IOTA Validator CLI](./cli/validator.mdx):** Use the `iota validator` command to access tools useful for IOTA validators.
- **[IOTA Genesis Ceremony CLI](./cli/ceremony.mdx):** Use the `iota ceremony` command to build a genesis blob.

Use the `help` flag for the commands that are not documented yet. For example, `iota validator --help`.  

## IOTA CLI Completion

You can generate completion files per shell using the `gen-completions` feature.

```sh
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git --branch <BRANCH-NAME> --features gen-completions iota
```

<Tabs groupId="shell">

<TabItem label="Bash" value="bash">

```sh
iota generate-completions -s bash -o ~/.iota
echo "source ~/.iota/iota.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Elvish" value="elvish">

The following commands create a new `iota` module and add it to the interactive startup script `rc.elv`.

```sh
mkdir ~/.config/elvish
iota generate-completions -s elvish -o ~/.config/elvish/lib
echo "use iota" >> ~/.config/elvish/rc.elv
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Fish" value="fish">

```sh
iota generate-completions -s fish -o ~/.config/fish/completions
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Powershell" value="powershell">

The following commands will create your profile if it doesn't exist and append the completions to it.
Only run it once as appending the completions twice will end up in errors.

```sh
touch $profile 
iota generate-completions -s powershell >> $profile
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Zsh" value="zsh">

In order to use Zsh completions, you must first install [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#basic-installation).

Then, install [`zsh-autocomplete`](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete?tab=readme-ov-file#installation--setup).

Finally, you can generate the completions file and install it using the following command:

```sh
iota generate-completions -s zsh -o ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

To see the completions, restart the terminal session.
