After a successful setup of a node, the next important step is to set up monitoring for the node.
Monitoring is important to keep track of the node's health and performance.

## Full Node Monitoring

### Test JSON RPC Interface
After the full node starts, you can test the [JSON-RPC interfaces](https://docs.iota.org/iota-api-ref).

### View Activity on Your Local Full Node with IOTA Explorer

The IOTA Explorer supports connecting to any network as long as it has `https` enabled. To view activity on your local full node:
- open the URL: [https://explorer.rebased.iota.org/](https://explorer.rebased.iota.org/)
- then select `Custom RPC URL` from the network dropdown in the top right.

### Node Health Metrics 

IOTA nodes expose a wide range of metrics to be scraped by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
By default, metrics are available at the `http://localhost:9184/metrics` endpoint.
The best way to visualize these metrics is to use [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).
Additionally, a common approach is to use [node exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) to scrape performance metrics from the node and push them to Prometheus.

Some of the important checks are:

1. Key health metrics via the `/metrics` HTTP endpoint:

```sh
curl -s localhost:9184/metrics | grep -E "^last_executed_checkpoint|^highest_synced_checkpoint|^highest_known_checkpoint|^last_committed_round|^consensus_threshold_clock_round|^highest_received_round|^consensus_proposed_blocks|^uptime"
```

```sh
highest_known_checkpoint 43448601
highest_synced_checkpoint 43448600
last_executed_checkpoint 43448601
last_executed_checkpoint_age_ms{pct="50"} 188
last_executed_checkpoint_age_ms{pct="95"} 221
last_executed_checkpoint_age_ms{pct="99"} 297
last_executed_checkpoint_age_ms_count 287523
last_executed_checkpoint_age_ms_sum 4291692609431
last_executed_checkpoint_timestamp_ms 1741700144842
uptime{chain_identifier="2304aa97",process="fullnode",version="0.10.3-rc-c2adf3fd68e9"} 20925
```

2. Follow the latest checkpoint known by your node via the JSON-RPC endpoint:

```shell
curl --json '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"iota_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber","params":[]}' localhost:9000 -s | jq .result
```
You can check that this matches the latest checkpoint known by the rest of the network by using the value found on https://explorer.rebased.iota.org/

### Monitoring Services

Implementing monitoring services is essential to ensure the reliability, security, and performance of the blockchain network by providing real-time insights, detecting anomalies, enabling proactive issue resolution, and receiving automatic alerts.

**Prometheus and Grafana** (recommended)

Example pre-made dashboards you can use:

- Community-owned grafana dashboard: https://github.com/stakeme-team/grafana-iota.
- Grafana setup for the [local private network](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/dev-tools/grafana-local), which might be a good example of how to build your own setup. 
- Officially supported dashboards can be found [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/tree/develop/setups/grafana) in the IOTA repository.

**Dolphin**  
Dolphin is a CLI tool that provides high-level features for validator, fullnode, and bridge monitoring. Under the hood, it uses the IOTA node Prometheus metric exporter to check the health of the node. More info: https://gitlab.com/blockscope-net/dolphin-v2.

## Logs

#### Configuring Logs

Log level (error, warn, info, trace) is controlled using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. 
The `RUST_LOG_JSON=1` environment variable can optionally be set to enable logging in JSON structured format.

Depending on your deployment method, these are configured in the following places:

<Tabs groupId="node-logs">
  <TabItem label="Systemd" value="logs-systemd">
    ```
    [Service]
    ...
    Environment=RUST_BACKTRACE=1
    Environment=RUST_LOG=info,iota_core=debug,consensus=debug,jsonrpsee=error
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Docker Compose" value="logs-docker">
    Add the following to the node container settings:
    ```yaml
    environment:
        - RUST_BACKTRACE=1
        - RUST_LOG=info,iota_core=debug,consensus=debug,jsonrpsee=error
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

It is possible to change the logging configuration while a node is running using the admin interface.

#### Verify Configured Logging Values

To view the currently configured logging values:
```sh
curl -w "\n" localhost:1337/logging
```

To change the currently configured logging values:
```sh
curl localhost:1337/logging -d "info"
```

#### Viewing Logs

<Tabs groupId="node-logs">
  <TabItem label="Systemd" value="logs-systemd">
    To view and follow the IOTA node logs:
    ```sh
    journalctl -u iota-node -f
    ```

    To search for a particular match:
    ```sh
    $ journalctl -u iota-node -g <SEARCH_TERM>
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Docker Compose" value="logs-docker">
    View and follow:
    ```sh
    sudo docker compose logs -f [node_container_name]
    ```

    By default, all logs are output. Limit this using `--since`:
    ```sh
    sudo docker logs --since 10m -f [node_container_name]
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
