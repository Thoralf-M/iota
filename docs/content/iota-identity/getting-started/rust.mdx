# Getting Started with Rust

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (latest)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) (latest)
- for running example: a local network node with the IOTA identity package deployed as described [here](./local-network-setup)

## Include the Library

To include IOTA Identity in your project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
identity_iota = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs", tag = "v1.6.0-beta"}
```

## Examples

To try out the [examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/tree/v1.6.0-beta/examples), you should:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs
```

2. Build the repository:

```bash
cargo build
```

3. Run your first example:

```bash
cargo run --example 0_create_did
```

## API Reference

You can find the API reference for the Rust library [here](https://iotaledger.github.io/identity/identity_iota/index.html).

If you would like to build the documentation, locally you can do so with the following command:

```
RUSTDOCFLAGS='--cfg docsrs' cargo +nightly doc -p identity_iota --all-features --no-deps --open
```
