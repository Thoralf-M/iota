# Sponsored Transactions: Part I

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a [sponsored transaction](../../iota-101/transactions/sponsored-transactions/about-sponsored-transactions.mdx) on the IOTA network using the [IOTA Rust SDK](../../../references/rust-sdk.mdx).
We are going to create a media platform, where users can subscribe to several types of content. There is a free trial option, from which users can try the service for a limited time.
For new users on the IOTA network, the platform admin will sponsor the gas fees for the `free trial` option. This will allow users to experience the platform without having to pay for gas fees nor subscription fees.



## Development Options

IOTA provides an implementation of a gas station server that you can deploy for virtually any use case. In this tutorial, we will:
1.  Use IOTA's [Gas Station server implementation](../../../operator/gas-station/gas-station.mdx) to sponsor the free trial option.
2.  Create a [custom Gas Station server](./gas-station-server.mdx) using the IOTA Rust SDK.

:::info
We strictly recommend using the IOTA's Gas Station server (option 1) for production use cases. However, building your own Gas Station server can be a good learning experience.
Option 2 is complementary, and you don't need to follow it if you are using the IOTA Gas Station server (option 1).

## Getting Started

To build the architecture, we are going to create two components:
1.   [The Media Platform's Move package for the sponsored transactions](./media-platform-package.mdx).
2.   [The Gas Station server](./production-gas-station.mdx).
3.   (Optional) [Custom Gas Station server](./gas-station-server.mdx) using the IOTA Rust SDK.

To complete this tutorial, you will need to follow the steps in each part in order. Good luck!
