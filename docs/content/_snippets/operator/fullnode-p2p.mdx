Configure the P2P settings in your `fullnode.yaml` file by following these steps:

1. Update the external address:

```yaml
p2p-config:
  external-address: /dns/<YOUR-DOMAIN>/udp/8084
```

:::note
Replace `<YOUR-DOMAIN>` with your public hostname.
In case you don't have a public hostname, you can alternatively use a public IPv4 like `/ip4/1.2.3.4/udp/8084/` or IPv6 like `/ip6/2001:db8::1234:5678/udp/8084`

This address must be accessible from the internet.
