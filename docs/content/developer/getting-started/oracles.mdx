# Introduction to Oracles in Blockchain

Smart contracts are powerful tools in the blockchain ecosystem, enabling automated, self-executing agreements based on
predefined conditions. However, one of their fundamental limitations is that they operate in a sandboxed environment.
This isolation ensures that smart contracts produce the same results every time they run, maintaining the deterministic
nature essential for blockchain's integrity and trust. But this also means smart contracts cannot directly access
or interact with external data or systems.

## Bridging the Gap with Oracles

Oracles serve as a critical bridge in this scenario, connecting the isolated world of smart contracts with external data
sources. They play a pivotal role in expanding the functionality of smart contracts by providing them
with real-world information. Oracles fetch data from various external sources, like internet APIs, real-world sensors,
and other data feeds, and then relay this information to the smart contracts on the blockchain.

### Ensuring Idempotent Results

The key challenge for oracles in the blockchain context is to provide data with enough specificity and reliability to
guarantee idempotent results - the property that a smart contract will produce the same outcome every time it's executed
under the same conditions. This consistency is crucial for maintaining trust and predictability in the blockchain
environment.

Oracles achieve this by sourcing data from reliable and verified external sources and using consensus mechanisms or
multiple data points to validate the information's accuracy. This process ensures that the data provided to the smart
contracts is relevant and timely, maintaining the integrity and deterministic nature of the blockchain
operations.

## Oracle Provider in IOTA Ecosystem

### Pyth

The Pyth Network delivers real-time financial market data across multiple blockchains and can be used in off-chain applications.
Pyth gets contributions from over 90 publishers, including several exchanges. It offers comprehensive and accurate price
feeds for asset classes such as US equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. Its price feeds get updates
multiple times per second, ensuring they are current and reliable.
