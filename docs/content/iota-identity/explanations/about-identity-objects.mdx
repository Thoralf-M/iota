# Introduction to On-chain Identities

DID documents allow us to digitally represent an entity’s identity, where "entity" refers to either person,
 object, institution, company, etc. DID documents can, therefore, be thought of as digital identities.

When a DID document is stored on a blockchain network, its Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) properties are enriched by the security guarantees of the DLT,
obtaining an on-chain identity.

## On-chain Identities with Multiple Controllers

The [DID method specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-controller) defines the DID controller as _an entity that
is authorized to make changes to a DID Document_. 
We leverage this definition to define an Identity's controller as an entity that is a DID controller to the Identity's
DID Document.

A DID document may have multiple controllers which can enact control over the document in two ways:
- [Independent control](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#independent-control);
- [Group control](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#group-control);

Similarly, on-chain Identities can have more than one controller, and the two control strategies mentioned above are instantiated
like so:
- [**Independent control**](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#independent-control): Each controller accesses the identity
  through its own address.  
- [**Group control**](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#group-control): Access to the Identity is multiplexed through an 
  address that is shared by all controllers (e.g., multi-sig address).

## The Identity Object
With "identity" or "Identity Object" we refer to an on-chain identity instanced on an IOTA network that complies with the
[IOTA DID method specification](../../references/iota-identity/iota-did-method-spec.mdx).

More specifically, an Identity Object is a **shared** _Move_ object that stores a single DID Document on the network,
allowing both on-chain and off-chain actors to interact with it.
Designing Identity as a shared object enables both aforementioned control strategies. This wouldn't be possible using owned 
objects, as they can only be referenced in transactions by their owner address - making _group control_ the only viable strategy
for shared control.


The Identity Object's unique ID is used to derive the actual DID of the DID Document it contains.

:::warning
Migrated Identities - i.e., those derived from legacy Stardust Identities through a migration operation - do not
share this property. The unique ID of a migrated Identity is not used to derive the Identity's DID; instead, it 
appears in the Identity's DID Document `alsoKnownAs` property.

## Identity's Access Control

An `Identity` is a shared object and is thus accessible by anyone. For this reason, it is of paramount importance to 
limit the use of an `Identity`'s APIs - especially its mutable ones - to only the intended actors.

### Controllers, `ControllerCap`, and `DelegationToken`
An Identity controller is an entity that is authorized to make changes to an Identity.
In order to allow a broader range of 
actors to act as an `Identity`'s controller - e.g., an `Identity` controlling another `Identity` - a controller is identified 
through its **controller capability** `ControllerCap`.
A `ControllerCap` is a token that allows anyone who possess it to invoke a controller-restricted capability on a given Identity.

Specifically, `ControllerCap`s are _non-store Move_ objects that behaves in a similar way to **soul-bound tokens** - i.e. they are attached to the address that owns them indefinitely and can only be destroyed after the controllers committee allows it.

Given the restrictive nature of `ControllerCap`, in order to support use-cases where the access to an Identity wants to be traded -
e.g., leasing it for some time or given to a smart contract - a new kind of `store`-able token is needed.
`DelegationToken` exists for this exact reason.

`DelegationToken` is a `store` _Move_ object that can only be minted from a `ControllerCap` and that allows whoever presents it
to act as a **delegate** of the controller who minted it. `DelegationToken`s can be revoked at any moment by the controllers 
committee. 
Furthermore, `DelegationToken`s come with a permissions list - set by the minting controller upon the token creation - that limits their capabilities.

:::warning
Not all `ControllerCap`s are allowed to mint `DelegationToken`s. When a new controller is added to the controllers committee it
is necessary to specify whether the new controller is allowed to delegate its access or not.

### Voting Power and Threshold
When an `Identity` has more than a single controller, an access control (AC) policy for the `Identity` must be established. Such 
a policy is represented by an unsigned integer **threshold** that is established upon the `Identity`'s creation.
Together with the `Identity`'s threshold, each controller is assigned a **voting power**, i.e. an unsigned integer that 
acts as a sort of _weight_ in the evaluation of an AC control policy.   

Giving different voting power or weights to each controller enables a wider range of AC policies that can be enforced on an 
Identity.

### Proposals
Whenever a controller wants to make a change to its `Identity`, a **proposal** encapsulating that change is created instead of 
carrying out the update right away.
To execute the changes contained in a `Proposal`, enough controllers need to approve it. The exact number of approvals 
depends on the controllers' voting powers, as well as the `Identity`'s threshold. 
`Proposal`s keep track of the approvals they receive by internally storing the sum of all approving controllers' voting powers 
in a field called `votes`.
A `Proposal` can only be executed after `votes` exceeds the `Identity`'s threshold.

## Identity Hierarchies
Creating hierarchies of identities can be extremely useful for modeling situations like subsidiaries for companies or custodians 
for humans.
To create such hierarchies, an identity must be able to control another. Achieving this is as simple as assigning an 
Identity as a controller of another Identity.

More concretely, assuming we have two Identities: Identity **A**, and Identity **B**; if we want to model the fact that **A** 
controls **B**, we add **A** to the list of **B**'s controllers by sending to **A**'s address a `ControllerCap` for Identity 
**B**.
With this setup in place, controllers of Identity **A** can borrow **A**'s `ControllerCap` to **B** and use it to invoke **A**'s
capability on **B**.

## Assets Ownership and Transfers

Identities, just like any other _Move_ object, can own assets - e.g. coins, NFTs, `ControllerCap`s. Controllers can access
an Identity's assets through different proposals to either borrow or send them.

Borrowing an Identity's assets allows a controller to reference them in a trasaction, in order to use them or update them;
the only restriction is that they have to be returned to the Identity in the same transaction.

Instead, sending an Identity's assets enables controllers to transfer them to another address, even their own.
