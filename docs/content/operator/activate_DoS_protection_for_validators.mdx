# Activating DoS Protection for Validators

Validator nodes are critical infrastructure in the IOTA network and should be protected against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The TrafficController is a built-in mechanism that helps protect validator nodes by monitoring and limiting traffic from potential attackers.

:::warning

This guide explains how to configure the TrafficController for your validator node.
All validator nodes should have this protection enabled by default.

:::

## TrafficController Overview

The TrafficController monitors incoming requests to your validator node and can block IP addresses that exceed certain thresholds. It can operate in two modes:

1. **Non-proxy mode** - For validators that receive traffic directly from clients.
2. **Proxy mode** - For validators behind load balancers or proxies.

## Configuration Parameters

The TrafficController is configured through two main configuration structures:

### PolicyConfig

This structure defines the traffic control policies:

```yaml
# The following parameters are defined in the PolicyConfig struct, which controls
# how the TrafficController identifies clients and applies rate limiting policies.
# The struct provides configuration for both direct client connections and proxied
# connections through load balancers.
policy-config:
  # How to identify client IPs (SocketAddr or XForwardedFor)
  client-id-source: SocketAddr  # or XForwardedFor(n) where n is the number of hops
  
  # How long to block direct client IPs (in seconds)
  connection-blocklist-ttl-sec: 60
  
  # How long to block proxied client IPs (in seconds)
  proxy-blocklist-ttl-sec: 60
  
  # Policy for handling spam traffic
  spam-policy-type: FreqThreshold
    client-threshold: 1000  # Requests per second threshold for direct clients
    proxied-client-threshold: 10  # Requests per second threshold for proxied clients
    window-size-secs: 30  # Time window for rate calculation
    update-interval-secs: 5  # Update interval for rate calculation
  
  # Policy for handling error traffic
  error-policy-type: NoOp  # Can be NoOp or FreqThreshold
  
  # Channel capacity for internal message passing
  channel-capacity: 100
  
  # Sampling rate for spam detection (0.0 to 1.0)
  spam-sample-rate: 0.2
  
  # Whether to run in dry-run mode (log but don't block)
  dry-run: false
```

### (Optional) RemoteFirewallConfig

For more advanced setups, you can delegate blocking to an external firewall:

```yaml
# The following parameters are defined in the RemoteFirewallConfig struct, which
# allows you to delegate traffic blocking to an external firewall service. This is
# useful for more advanced setups where you want to integrate with existing
# firewall infrastructure or need more sophisticated blocking capabilities beyond
# what the built-in traffic controller provides.
firewall-config:
  # URL of the remote firewall service
  remote-fw-url: "http://127.0.0.1:65000"
  
  # Destination port to block
  
  destination-port: 8080
  # Whether to delegate spam blocking to the firewall
  delegate-spam-blocking: true
  
  # Whether to delegate error blocking to the firewall
  delegate-error-blocking: false
  
  # Path to the drain file for dead man's switch
  drain-path: "/tmp/drain"
  
  # Timeout in seconds after which the dead man's switch is triggered
  drain-timeout-secs: 300
```

## Non-Proxy Mode Configuration

If your validator node receives traffic directly from clients (no proxy or load balancer in front), use this configuration:

```yaml
policy-config:
  client-id-source: SocketAddr
  connection-blocklist-ttl-sec: 60
  proxy-blocklist-ttl-sec: 0
  spam-policy-type:
    freq-threshold:
      client-threshold: 100  # Adjust based on your expected legitimate traffic
      proxied-client-threshold: 0  # Not used in non-proxy mode
      window-size-secs: 30
      update-interval-secs: 5
  error-policy-type: NoOp
  channel-capacity: 100
  spam-sample-rate: 0.2
  dry-run: false  # Set to true initially to monitor without blocking
```

## Proxy Mode Configuration

If your validator is behind a load balancer or proxy, use this configuration:

```yaml
policy-config:
  # Configure with the number of proxy hops between client and node
  # For example, if you have one proxy: client -> proxy -> node, use 1
  client-id-source:
    x-forwarded-for: 1  # Adjust based on your infrastructure
  
  connection-blocklist-ttl-sec: 60
  proxy-blocklist-ttl-sec: 60
  spam-policy-type:
    freq-threshold:
      client-threshold: 1000  # Higher threshold for proxies that aggregate traffic
      proxied-client-threshold: 10  # Threshold for individual clients behind proxies
      window-size-secs: 30
      update-interval-secs: 5
  error-policy-type: NoOp
  channel-capacity: 100
  spam-sample-rate: 0.2
  dry-run: false
```

### Determining the Correct Number of Hops

To determine the correct number of hops for the `x-forwarded-for` setting:

1. Set `x-forwarded-for: 0` temporarily.
2. Run the node and query any endpoint from a known IP address.
3. Check the logs for lines containing `x-forwarded-for`.
4. The correct value is 1 + the number of IP addresses that appear after your known IP in the header.

## What if I'm Unsure of the Number of Proxies?

If you're unsure about the correct number of proxies to configure, you can use the [`config-traffic-control.sh`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota/blob/develop/setups/validator/config-traffic-control.sh) script included in the IOTA codebase. This script analyzes your node logs to determine the correct configuration.

Follow these steps:

1. Configure `x-forwarded-for` in the policy config to `0`, which is a special case setting that allows the node to provide logging details of the `x-forwarded-for` header contents:

```yaml
policy-config:
  client-id-source:
    x-forwarded-for: 0
```

2. Restart your node.
3. Tail the node logs and pipe them into the script, providing as an additional argument an IP address of a known host that you can use to query any endpoint of your validator:

```bash
journalctl -fu iota-node | setups/validator/config-traffic-control.sh "YOUR_KNOWN_IP_ADDRESS"
```

4. Using the host whose IP was provided to the script, query any endpoint of your validator. The script will collect request data and provide a recommended configuration:

```bash
journalctl -fu iota-node | setups/validator/config-traffic-control.sh "YOUR_KNOWN_IP_ADDRESS"
x-forwarded-for contents: YOUR_KNOWN_IP_ADDRESS
Configuration:
  client-id-source:
    x-forwarded-for: 1
```

5. Set the configuration as specified by the script.
6. Restart your node to apply the new configuration.

The script automatically calculates the correct number of hops by analyzing the position of your known IP address in the `x-forwarded-for` header.

## Recommended Production Settings

For production validator nodes, we recommend:

```yaml
policy-config:
  # Use SocketAddr for direct connections or x-forwarded-for for proxied setups
  client-id-source: SocketAddr  # Adjust based on your setup
  
  connection-blocklist-ttl-sec: 300  # Block for 5 minutes
  proxy-blocklist-ttl-sec: 300  # Block for 5 minutes
  
  spam-policy-type:
    freq-threshold:
      # Adjust these thresholds based on your expected legitimate traffic
      client-threshold: 50  # Requests per second
      proxied-client-threshold: 10  # Requests per second per client behind proxy
      window-size-secs: 30
      update-interval-secs: 5
  
  # Consider enabling error policy for production
  error-policy-type:
    freq-threshold:
      client-threshold: 20  # Error requests per second
      proxied-client-threshold: 5
      window-size-secs: 30
      update-interval-secs: 5
  
  channel-capacity: 100
  spam-sample-rate: 0.5  # Sample half of all requests
  dry-run: false  # Ensure this is false for actual protection
```

## Monitoring and Tuning

After enabling the `TrafficController`, monitor your node's metrics to ensure legitimate traffic isn't being blocked. Key metrics to watch:

- `traffic_controller_tallies`
- `traffic_controller_connection_ip_blocklist_len`
- `traffic_controller_proxy_ip_blocklist_len`
- `traffic_controller_requests_blocked_at_protocol`
- `traffic_controller_num_dry_run_blocked_requests`

Start with `dry-run: true` to observe what would be blocked without actually blocking traffic, then adjust thresholds as needed before setting `dry-run: false`.

## Troubleshooting

If legitimate traffic is being blocked:

1. Increase the `client-threshold` and `proxied-client-threshold` values.
2. Decrease the `connection-blocklist-ttl-sec` and `proxy-blocklist-ttl-sec` values.
3. Adjust the `window-size-secs` to be longer for more forgiving rate calculation.

If you're still experiencing DoS attacks:

1. Decrease the thresholds.
2. Increase the blocklist TTL values.
3. Consider implementing an external firewall using the `firewall-config` option.
