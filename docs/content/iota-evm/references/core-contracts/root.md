# The `root` Contract

The `root` contract is one of the [core contracts](overview.md) on each IOTA Smart Contracts chain.

This contract is responsible for the initialization of the chain. It is the first smart contract deployed on the chain and, upon receiving the `init` request, bootstraps the state of the chain. Deploying all of the other core contracts is a part of the state initialization.

The `root` contract also functions as a smart contract factory for the chain: upon request, it deploys other smart contracts and maintains an on-chain registry of smart contracts in its state. The contract registry keeps a list of contract records containing their respective name, hname, description, and creator.
