# The local path where checkpoints are stored. For optimal performance,
# this should match the IOTA Node's ingestion path when running on the same host.
# Using the same path as the Node allows direct file access instead of HTTP requests,
# significantly improving sync speed.

# IOTA Node Rest API URL
#
# The IOTA Node's REST API URL acts as a fallback mechanism for fetching checkpoints
# when they are not available in the local ingestion path. This provides redundancy
# and ensures data availability even when local files are not accessible.
#
# Note: This URL is optional when:
# 1. The ingestion path matches the IOTA Node's path on same host machine)
# 2. You don't need a fallback mechanism for data retrieval
# 3. Local filesystem access is sufficient for your use case
#
# Required when:
# 1. Running on a different host than the IOTA Node
# 2. Using a different path than the Node
# 3. HTTP access is preferred over local filesystem

# Path to the progress store JSON file.
#
# The ingestion pipeline uses this file to persist its progress,
# ensuring state is preserved across restarts.

  # - checkpoint summary
  # - checkpoint constents

  # Primerely is used to provide historical data for Archival IOTA Node
  # which trough HttpKVStore fetches data trough a REST API which reads
